Quick summary of initial EDA findings:

Total call volume seems to stay relatively flat until 2017-2019, with 2019 the largest single-year call volume of 178,000. 

Most frequent call is Austin Code Enforcement, with nearly 180,000 calls. 

Over the course of the year, calls seem to decrease in the Fall and Winter, and rise in the Spring with a peak in the Summer. April through August all over 100,000 calls per month within the sample. 

Phone remains the most common method of reporting, with Spot311 growing as the 2nd most common. 

Geographically, the South-Southwest side of town seems to get the largest volume of calls, with 78704 and 78745 most common across all years, and most common within many individual years as well. 

Preliminary analysis of the Austin Code Enforcement database reflects this same geographic pattern. Dataset is not as extensive, seemingly just since 2017, and not as clean. 

Overall the addresses do not seem to be as available, but both lat-long and zip codes seem to be largely reliable.
